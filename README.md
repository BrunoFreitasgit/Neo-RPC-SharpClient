# Neo-RPC-SharpClient (not finished yet, still more tests to be added)*

This project aims to be a full RPC client for the NEO network created in C# and inspired by [Nethereum](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum). You can use it support your mobile wallet, websites, neo blockchain data gathering, etc. 

Was develop with decoupling in mind to make maintenance and new RPC methods implemented more quickly:

* Client base - Neo.JsonRpc.Client project
* RPC client implementation - Neo.JsonRpc.RpcClient project
* DTO'S, Services, Helpers - Neo.RPC (main project)
* Tests - Neo.RPC.Tests

(* simple readme just to submit to CoZ repo)
